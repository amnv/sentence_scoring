	<sentence>Current <cell_type>procedures</cell_type> usecost-prohibitive DNA sequencing methods to discriminate 5hmC from 5mC , limiting <cell_type>their</cell_type> accessibilityto the scientific community . </sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>Here</cell_type> wereport a method that combines TET-assisted bisulfite <cell_type>conversion</cell_type> withIllumina 450K DNA methylation arrays for a low-cost high-throughput approach that distinguishes 5hmC and 5mC signals . </sentence>
	<sentence>With the ability to discriminate 5mC and 5hmC , we found a much larger <cell_type>number</cell_type> ofdynamically methylated genomic regions implicated in the development of these lineages than we <cell_type>could</cell_type> detectby 5mC analysis alone . </sentence>
	<sentence>The <cell_type>increased</cell_type> resolutionand <cell_type>accuracy</cell_type> affordedby this approach provides a powerful means to investigate the distinct contributions of 5mC and 5hmC in human development and disease . </sentence>

	<sentence>DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation have been implicated in <cell_type>normal</cell_type> developmentand differentiation , but our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine ( 5mC ) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ) during <cell_type>cellular</cell_type> differentiationremains limited . </sentence>
	<sentence>Using in vitro model system of gradual differentiation of human embryonic stem ( hES ) <cell_type>cells</cell_type> intoventral midbrain-type <cell_type>neural</cell_type> precursor( NP ) cells and terminally into dopamine ( DA ) neurons , we explored changes in 5mC or 5hmC patterns during lineage commitment . </sentence>
	<sentence>We used three techniques , 450K DNA methylation array , MBD-seq , and hMeDIP-seq , and found combination of these methods can provide <cell_type>comprehensive information</cell_type> onthe genome-wide 5mC or 5hmC patterns . </sentence>
	<sentence>Our findings may provide clues for elucidating the molecular mechanisms <cell_type>underlying</cell_type> lineagespecific differentiation of pluripotent stem <cell_type>cells</cell_type> duringhuman embryonic development . </sentence>
	<sentence>DNA methylation changes in <cell_type>neuroblastoma</cell_type> ,a <cell_type>clinically-heterogeneous</cell_type> pediatrictumor , have been described essentially in promoter regions . </sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>We</cell_type> analyzedthe DNA methylome of <cell_type>neuroblastoma</cell_type> usinghigh-density microarrays and observed differential methylation not only in promoters but also in intragenic and intergenic regions at both CpG and non-CpG sites . </sentence>
	<sentence>These epigenetic changes showed a non-random distribution relative functional chromatin domains , and targeted development and <cell_type>cancer-related</cell_type> genes, relevant for <cell_type>neuroblastoma</cell_type> pathogenesis. </sentence>
	<sentence>Furthermore , tumors with diverse clinical-risk showed <cell_type>clear</cell_type> differencesaffecting CpG and , <cell_type>remarkably</cell_type> ,non-CpG sites . </sentence>
	<sentence>Finally , we identified CpG and non-CpG methylation signatures which <cell_type>correlated</cell_type> withpatient ’ s age at time-points relevant for neuroblastoma clinical behavior , and targeted genes related to <cell_type>neural</cell_type> developmentand neural crest regulatory network . </sentence>
	<sentence>Pilocytic astrocytomas ( PA ) are the most common brain tumor in pediatric patients and <cell_type>can</cell_type> causesignificant morbidity , including chronic <cell_type>neurological</cell_type> deficiencies. </sentence>
	<sentence>They are characterized by activating alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway , but little <cell_type>else</cell_type> isknown about <cell_type>their</cell_type> development. </sentence>
	<sentence>These data revealed two subgroups of PA that separate according to tumor location ( infratentorial versus supratentorial ) , and identified key <cell_type>neural</cell_type> developmentalgenes that are differentially methylated between the two groups . </sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>Integration</cell_type> withtranscriptome microarray data highlighted significant expression differences , which were unexpectedly associated with a strong positive <cell_type>correlation</cell_type> betweenmethylation and expression . </sentence>
	<sentence>We also identified a large number of differentially methylated genes between <cell_type>cerebellar</cell_type> PAsand <cell_type>normal</cell_type> cerebellum, which included additional developmental genes . </sentence>
	<sentence>The presence of an extra whole or part of chromosome 21 in people with Down syndrome ( DS ) is associated with multiple <cell_type>neurological</cell_type> changes, including pathological aging that often meets the <cell_type>criteria</cell_type> forAlzheimer ’ s Disease ( AD ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>We therefore examined whole-genome DNA methylation in <cell_type>buccal</cell_type> epithelial<cell_type>cells</cell_type> ofadults with DS to determine whether patterns of DNA methylation correlated with DS and/or cognitive impairment . </sentence>
	<sentence>In addition we examined DNA methylation at the APP gene <cell_type>itself</cell_type> ,to see whether there <cell_type>were</cell_type> changesin DNA methylation in this population . </sentence>
	<sentence>Using the Illumina 450K Human Methylation Array , we examined more than 485,000 CpG sites distributed across the genome in <cell_type>buccal</cell_type> epithelial<cell_type>cells</cell_type> .</sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>We</cell_type> found297 CpGs to be differentially methylated between the groups , including 26 genes that were represented by more than <cell_type>one</cell_type> CpG. </sentence>
	<sentence>In addition , we found 331 probes that were <cell_type>correlated</cell_type> withcognitive function including 23 genes represented by more than <cell_type>one</cell_type> probe. </sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>Overall</cell_type> ,our results indicate that both Trisomy 21 and cognitive impairment are associated with distinct patterns of DNA methylation . </sentence>
	<sentence>Data for 4/9 groups were generated from glucosylated and bisulfite converted DNA , from human induced plurupotent stem <cell_type>cells</cell_type> (hIPSCs ) , differentiated cardiovascular progenitors ( CVPs ) , differentiated <cell_type>neural</cell_type> progenitors( NPCs ) , and fibroblasts . </sentence>
	<sentence>Data for the <cell_type>next</cell_type> 4/9groups were generated from glucosylated , TET-oxidized and bisulfite <cell_type>converted</cell_type> DNA, from and included replicates of hIPSCs , CVPs , NPCs , and fibroblasts . </sentence>
