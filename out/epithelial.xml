	<sentence>Cellular senescence is a stable arrest of proliferation and is considered a key component of processes associated <cell_type>with</cell_type> carcinogenesisand other ageing-related phenotypes . </sentence>
	<sentence>However , till now , <cell_type>biological</cell_type> markersthat define senescence on a genome-wide scale have been limited . </sentence>
	<sentence>Here , we report a DNA methylomic analysis of actively dividing and deeply senescent normal human <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cells, identifying 3,852 senescence-associated differentially methylated positions ( senDMPs ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>We find that this human senDMP signature is positively and significantly correlated <cell_type>with</cell_type> bothcancer and ageing-associated methylomic dynamics . </sentence>
	<sentence>We also identify germline genetic variants , including those associated <cell_type>with</cell_type> thep16INK4A locus , that are associated with the presence of in vivo senDMP signatures . </sentence>
	<sentence>Importantly , we also demonstrate that <cell_type>the</cell_type> senDMPsignature can be effectively reversed in a newly-developed protocol of transient cellular rejuvenation . </sentence>
	<sentence>The senDMP signature has significant potential for understanding some of the key ( <cell_type>epi</cell_type> )genetic etiological factors that lead to cancer and age-related diseases in humans . </sentence>
	<sentence>DNA <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> hasbecome increasingly recognized in the etiology of psychiatric disorders . </sentence>
	<sentence>Because brain tissue is not accessible in living humans , <cell_type>epigenetic</cell_type> studiesare most often conducted in blood . </sentence>
	<sentence>Saliva is often collected for genotyping studies but is rarely used to examine DNA methylation because the proportion of <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellsand leukocytes varies extensively between individuals . </sentence>
	<sentence>The goal of this study was to <cell_type>evaluate</cell_type> whethersaliva DNA is informative for studies of psychiatric disorders . </sentence>
	<sentence>Saliva and blood <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> wasclearly distinguishable though there was positive correlation overall . </sentence>
	<sentence>There was little correlation in CpG sites <cell_type>within</cell_type> relevantcandidate genes . </sentence>
	<sentence>Correlated CpG sites were more likely to occur in areas of low CpG <cell_type>density</cell_type> (i.e . </sentence>
	<sentence>There was more variability in CpG sites from saliva than blood , which may reflect <cell_type>its</cell_type> heterogeneity. </sentence>
	<sentence>Thus , this study provides a framework for using DNA methylation from saliva and suggests that DNA methylation of saliva may offer distinct opportunities for <cell_type>epidemiological</cell_type> andlongitudinal studies of psychiatric traits . </sentence>
	<sentence>Both saliva and blood samples were collected from <cell_type>each</cell_type> participant. </sentence>
	<sentence>Saliva was stored in Oragene DNA sample collection kits ( DNA <cell_type>Genotek</cell_type> ), and blood was collected in EDTA vacuum tubes . </sentence>

	<sentence>Analyses for tissue-specific DNA patterns were conducted using linear regression adjusted for appropriate covariates , including <cell_type>estimated</cell_type> cellularproportions . </sentence>
	<sentence>The estimated proportion of <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellsin saliva DNA ranged from 3-99 % ( median 26 % ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>In blood , <cell_type>the</cell_type> estimatedproportion of lymphocytes ranged from 25-70 % ( median 48 % ) and neutrophils ranged from 42-84 % ( median 58 % ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>Methylation of 68.8 % of all CpG sites differed relative to <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellproportion ( FDR < .05 ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>Our results provide a framework for methylation studies in DNA extracted from saliva and highlight the importance of controlling for the proportion of <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> andleukocyte cells . </sentence>

	<sentence>Induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells are a valuable resource for discovery of <cell_type>epigenetic</cell_type> changescritical to cell type-specific differentiation . </sentence>
	<sentence>Although iPS cells have been generated from other terminally differentiated cells , the reprogramming of normal adult human basal prostatic <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> (E-PZ ) cells to a pluripotent state has not been reported . </sentence>
	<sentence>Here , we attempted to reprogram E-PZ cells by forced <cell_type>expression</cell_type> ofOct4 , Sox2 , c-Myc , and Klf4 using lentiviral vectors and obtained embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) -like colonies at a frequency of 0.01 % . </sentence>
	<sentence>These E-PZ-iPS-like cells with normal karyotype gained expression of pluripotent genes typical of iPS cells ( Tra-1-81 , SSEA-3 , Nanog , Sox2 , and Oct4 ) and lost gene expression characteristic of basal prostatic <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cells( CK5 , CK14 , and p63 ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>E-PZ-iPS-like cells demonstrated pluripotency by differentiating into ectodermal , mesodermal , and endodermal cells in vitro , although lack of teratoma formation in vivo and incomplete <cell_type>demethylation</cell_type> ofpluripotency genes suggested only partial reprogramming . </sentence>
	<sentence>Importantly , E-PZ-iPS-like cells re-expressed basal <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellmarkers ( CD44 , p63 , MAO-A ) in response to prostate-specific medium in spheroid culture . </sentence>
	<sentence>Androgen induced expression of androgen receptor ( AR ) , and co-culture with rat urogenital sinus further induced expression of prostate-specific antigen , a hallmark of secretory cells , suggesting that E-PZ-iPS-like cells have the capacity to differentiate into prostatic basal and secretory <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cells. </sentence>
	<sentence>Finally , when injected into mice , E-PZ-iPS-like cells expressed basal <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellmarkers including CD44 and p63 . </sentence>
	<sentence>DNA <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> profilingidentified key pathways and regulators of prostatic differentiation including Wnt5a , BPM7 , PTEN , and NKx3.1 using E-PZ-iPS-lke cells . </sentence>
	<sentence>Our results suggest that iPS-like cells can be derived from prostatic <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cells. </sentence>
	<sentence>These cells are pluripotent and capable of prostatic differentiation , and therefore provide a novel model for investigating <cell_type>epigenetic</cell_type> changesinvolved in prostate cell lineage specification . </sentence>
	<sentence>Limbal <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> stemcell ( LESC ) deficiency represents a significant clinical problem especially in bilateral cases . </sentence>
	<sentence>Induced <cell_type>pluripotent</cell_type> stemcells ( iPSC ) may be a promising source of LESC , allowing standardized and continual propagation and banking . </sentence>
	<sentence>The objective of this study was to generate iPSC from human limbal <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> culturesand differentiate them back into limbal epithelial cells using substrata mimicking the natural LESC niche . </sentence>
	<sentence>Using Yamanaka ’ s <cell_type>episomal</cell_type> vectorslimbal-derived iPSC were reprogrammed from LESC cultured from donor corneoscleral rims and from human skin fibroblasts . </sentence>
	<sentence>A clone from limbal-derived iPSC expressed stemness markers , had a diploid karyotype , and produced teratomas in nude mice representing <cell_type>three</cell_type> germlayers . </sentence>
	<sentence>Compared to parental LESC , this clone had fewer specific gene <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> changesrevealed using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450k Beadchips than compared to skin fibroblasts . </sentence>
	<sentence>The <cell_type>expression</cell_type> ofputative LESC markers was examined by quantitative RT-PCR and immunostaining in limbal-derived and fibroblast-derived iPSC cultured on denuded human amniotic membrane or denuded cornea . </sentence>
	<sentence>Limbal-derived iPSC had markedly stronger <cell_type>expression</cell_type> ofPAX6 , ABCG2 , Np63 , keratins 14 , 15 , 17 , and N-cadherin than fibroblast-derived iPSC . </sentence>
	<sentence>The data suggest that iPSC differentiation to a desired lineage may be facilitated by their generation from <cell_type>the</cell_type> sametissue . </sentence>
	<sentence>This may be related to preservation of parental tissue <cell_type>epigenetic</cell_type> methylationsignatures in iPSC and use of biological substrata similar to the natural niche of parental cells . </sentence>
	<sentence>Nasal <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cells( NECs ) were plated in 12-well dishes pre-coated with 0.2 mg/mL Type I purified collagen ( Vitrogen 100 , Advanced Biomatrix Corp. ) in complete Bronchial Epithelial Cell Media ( BEGM , Lonza ) and incubated at 37°C with 5 % CO2 until 80-90 % confluence was achieved . </sentence>

	<sentence>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is rare malignancy in most parts around <cell_type>the</cell_type> worldbut common in Southern China and Southeast Asia , Annually , approximately 80,000 new NPC cases and 50,000 deaths are reported worldwide . </sentence>
	<sentence>In NPC , recent advances have shown that many genes that are predominantly or even exclusively silenced by DNA methylation in <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellsduring pathogenesis of NPC . </sentence>
	<sentence>However , the causal relationship between DNA <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> statusand outcome in NPC remains not well understood . </sentence>
	<sentence>To investigate this problem , we used Illumina 450K BeadChips to examined <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> patternsand survival in NPC . </sentence>
	<sentence>and ultimately provided insight into prognostic value of DNA <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> inNPC clinical management . </sentence>
	<sentence>overall tumour histology : <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancers ( NSCLC ) comprise multiple distinct biological groups with different prognoses . </sentence>
	<sentence>For example , patients with <cell_type>epithelial-like</cell_type> (EL ) tumors have a better prognosis and exhibit greater sensitivity to inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) pathway than patients with mesenchymal-like ( ML ) tumors . </sentence>
	<sentence>RESULTS : We show that patterns of <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> divideNSCLCs into EL and ML subsets as defined by gene expression and that these signatures are similarly correlated in NSCLC cell lines and tumors . </sentence>
	<sentence>We identify multiple DMRs , including ERBB2 and ZEB2 , whose methylation status is strongly associated with an <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> phenotypein NSCLC cell lines , surgically resected tumors , and formalin-fixed biopsies from NSCLC patients who went on to fail front-line chemotherapy . </sentence>
	<sentence>The aim of this study was to identify new candidate genes that are differentially methylated in squamous cell carcinoma compared to the DNA samples from cervical <cell_type>intraepithelial</cell_type> neoplasiagrade 3 ( CIN3 ) and normal cervical scrapes . </sentence>

	<sentence>The immortalized human mammary <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellline ( HMLE ) and the derivative cell line HMLE-Twist-ER were kindly provided by the Robert Weinberg laboratory ( MIT ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>The culture of the cells was carried out as described previously ( Elenbaas <cell_type>et</cell_type> al., 2001 ; Mani et al. , 2008 ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>The presence of an extra whole or part of chromosome 21 in people with Down syndrome ( DS ) is associated with multiple neurological changes , including <cell_type>pathological</cell_type> agingthat often meets the criteria for Alzheimer ’ s Disease ( AD ) . </sentence>
	<sentence>While the mechanism underlying these changes is unknown , <cell_type>it</cell_type> hasbeen hypothesized that the presence of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) on chromosome 21 may contribute to the phenotype . </sentence>
	<sentence>We therefore examined whole-genome DNA methylation in buccal <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cellsof adults with DS to determine whether patterns of DNA methylation correlated with DS and/or cognitive impairment . </sentence>
	<sentence>In addition we examined DNA <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> atthe APP gene itself , to see whether there were changes in DNA methylation in this population . </sentence>
	<sentence>Using the Illumina 450K Human Methylation Array , we examined more than 485,000 CpG sites distributed across the genome in buccal <cell_type>epithelial</cell_type> cells. </sentence>
	<sentence>We found 297 CpGs to be differentially <cell_type>methylated</cell_type> betweenthe groups , including 26 genes that were represented by more than one CpG . </sentence>
	<sentence>In addition , we found 331 probes that were correlated <cell_type>with</cell_type> cognitivefunction including 23 genes represented by more than one probe . </sentence>
	<sentence>We found no enrichment on chromosome 21 and targeted analysis of the APP gene revealed weak evidence for <cell_type>epigenetic</cell_type> impactsrelated to the AD phenotype . </sentence>
	<sentence>Overall , our results indicate that both Trisomy 21 and cognitive impairment are associated <cell_type>with</cell_type> distinctpatterns of DNA methylation . </sentence>
