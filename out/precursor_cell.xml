	<sentence><cell_type>B-cell precursor</cell_type> acutelymphoblastic leukemia ( pre-B ALL ) is the most common pediatric cancer . </sentence>
	<sentence>Although the genetic origin of the disease remains <cell_type>unclear</cell_type> ,epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation <cell_type>are</cell_type> suggestedto contribute significantly to leukemogenesis . </sentence>
	<sentence>We assessed the DNA methylation status of 402,842 CpG-sites across the genome ( Illumina 450k array ) in tumor and remission samples of 46 <cell_type>pre-B</cell_type> ALLpatients , thus generating the most <cell_type>comprehensive</cell_type> singleCpG-site resolution pre-B ALL methylomes so far . </sentence>
	<sentence>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of CpG-site neighborhood , protein-coding gene , or miRNA gene associated methylation levels separated the tumor cohort according to major <cell_type>pre-B</cell_type> ALLsubtypes , and methylation in CpG islands , shores , and in regions around the transcription start site of protein-coding genes strongly <cell_type>correlated</cell_type> withtranscript expression . </sentence>
	<sentence>Further intersection with transcriptome data identified <cell_type>methylation</cell_type> toimpact <cell_type>expression</cell_type> of18 genes . </sentence>
	<sentence>In summary , our data illustrate the power of methylation profiling to <cell_type>classify</cell_type> leukemicsubtypes and to identify subtype-specific methylation <cell_type>markers</cell_type> .</sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>Further</cell_type> ,we demonstrate that integration of methylome and transcriptome alterations <cell_type>allows</cell_type> thestudy of downstream effects of individual genomic rearrangements in cancer . </sentence>
	<sentence>Bisulfite converted genomic DNA lysates from human pluripotent stem cell-derived hematopoietic <cell_type>precursor cells</cell_type> (CD34+CD38-CD43+ lineage marker- ) were hybridized to Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip . </sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>cell</cell_type> type: B-cell <cell_type>precursors</cell_type> atS1 , predominantly multipotent progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors . </sentence>

	<sentence>Comparative studies in primates are extremely restricted because we only have access to a few types of <cell_type>cell</cell_type> linesfrom non-human <cell_type>apes</cell_type> andto a limited collection of frozen tissues . </sentence>
	<sentence>In order to gain better insight into regulatory <cell_type>processes</cell_type> thatunderlie variation in complex phenotypes , we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of tissues and <cell_type>cell</cell_type> types. </sentence>
	<sentence>To facilitate this , we have generated a <cell_type>panel</cell_type> of7 fully characterized chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) induced pluripotent stem <cell_type>cell</cell_type> (iPSC ) lines derived from fibroblasts of healthy donors . </sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>All</cell_type> linesare free of integration from exogenous reprogramming <cell_type>vectors</cell_type> ,can be maintained using standard iPSC culture techniques , and have proliferative and differentiation potential similar to human and mouse lines . </sentence>
	<sentence>To begin demonstrating the utility of comparative iPSC panels , we collected RNA-seq data and methylation profiles from the chimpanzee iPSCs and their corresponding fibroblast <cell_type>precursors</cell_type> ,as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their precursors , which were of multiple <cell_type>cell</cell_type> typeand population origins . </sentence>
	<sentence>Overall , we observed much less regulatory variation within species in the iPSCs than in the somatic <cell_type>precursors</cell_type> ,indicating that the reprogramming process has erased many of the differences observed between somatic <cell_type>cells</cell_type> ofdifferent origins . </sentence>
	<sentence>Our panel <cell_type>will</cell_type> helprealise the potential of iPSCs , and in combination with genomic technologies , transform studies of comparative evolution in <cell_type>primates</cell_type> .</sentence>
	<sentence>Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal kidney ( n=36 ) , nephrogenic rest ( n=22 ) and Wilms tumour ( n=37 ) was <cell_type>performed</cell_type> usingthe <cell_type>Illumina</cell_type> 450karray . </sentence>
	<sentence>Two papers were composed after analysis of this data ( 1 ) describes comparative analysis of 22 matched normal kidney-Wilms tumour pairs which identified biomarker differentially methylated regions ( DMRs ) that <cell_type>could</cell_type> bedetected in patient blood ; ( 2 ) describes comparative analysis of 20 matched trios which identified changes in methylation associated with progression from the <cell_type>precursor</cell_type> lesiontowards tumourigenesis . </sentence>
	<sentence>Germ <cell_type>cell</cell_type> tumours( GCTs ) <cell_type>are</cell_type> acomplex group of malignancies . </sentence>
	<sentence>They are unique in developing from a pluripotent <cell_type>progenitor cell</cell_type> .</sentence>
	<sentence>The initial lesion is believed to be the relatively benign <cell_type>precursor</cell_type> lesion( ICGNU ) , from which either highly chemosensitive seminomas or the more aggressive non-seminomas <cell_type>develop</cell_type> .</sentence>
	<sentence><cell_type>Previous</cell_type> analysesof selected genes have suggested that non-seminomas exhibit much higher <cell_type>levels</cell_type> ofDNA methylation than seminomas . </sentence>
	<sentence>However , the genomic targets that are methylated , the extent to which this <cell_type>results</cell_type> ingene silencing and the identity of the silenced genes most <cell_type>likely</cell_type> toplay a role in the tumours â€™ biology have not yet been established . </sentence>
	<sentence>Large differences in the level of methylation of the CpG islands of individual genes between tumour <cell_type>cell</cell_type> linescorrelated well with differential gene <cell_type>expression</cell_type> .</sentence>
	<sentence>Treatment of non-seminoma <cell_type>cells</cell_type> with5-aza-2-deoxycytidine verified that methylation of all genes tested did indeed play a role in their silencing and many of these genes were also differentially expressed in <cell_type>primary</cell_type> tumours. </sentence>
	<sentence>Through this approach the genes silenced in the <cell_type>various</cell_type> GCT<cell_type>cell</cell_type> lineswere identified . </sentence>
	<sentence>Silencing of these factors that <cell_type>normally</cell_type> suppresssomatic differentiation might play an important role in the <cell_type>progression</cell_type> tonon-seminoma formation . </sentence>
